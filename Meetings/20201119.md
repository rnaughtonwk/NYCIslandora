## Presentation: WIDEN DAMS (Deborah)
 * Deborah gave a presentation on the WIDEN digital asset management system used at Brooklyn Public Library, demonstrating aspects of both its user interface and backend functionality.  A lively discussion followed, on topics such as workflow, ingesting, metadata and more.  

## Notes from the field 
  * Henry spoke about problems N-YHS is currently having with its Islandora system – not being able to ingest, slow image loading, etc.  Diego said this typically happens to installations with a large number of digital assets. They expect it to be resolved soon.
  * Diego showed several things he’s been working on: IMI expanding PDFs to multiple pages in Islandora 7, and functionality in Archipelago such as working with archived web sites and finding aids, and enabling images to be notated.   
* There was interest from the group in hearing more about Archipelago overall, possibly as a presentation at a future meeting.   

  ## Next Steps 
* Next meeting to be held Thursday, Dec. 17 from 4-5 PM.
