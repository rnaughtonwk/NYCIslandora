#AGENDA

##Welcome & Introductions

Meetings
* Try 3 - 5pm for meetings which is part of the work day.  We discussed changing the timing to be part of the work day since it is professional development.  Each person can confirm with his/her institutions about the timing.
Doodle Poll for days and locations.  
Membership - reaching out to more people
Need to have a plan that’s attractive to others so that they will be interested in participating.  We can reach out to organizations and groups based in NYC thinking about and/or using Islandora.
Free professional development - we can provide training about the use of Islandora. 
Something that is concrete that people can take with them.
Initial meeting - new people.   Provide introduction to Islandora 
Activities
A session once/twice a year for intro and use cases
Digital Humanities workshop - http://dhweek.nycdh.org/ - Feb. 5 - 9.  See below for the survey form to submit a workshop.

Henry can discuss the multi-importer.
Helpdesk - bring your problem and we’ll work it out.  Meetups such as WordPress does something similar where attendees can help each other or speak to people at the helpdesk about an issue.  We can use a similar model where we can work on specific problems/issues encountered during one of the monthly meetings.
Exchange of services with other smaller institutions - this is a barter idea that would be a way to share knowledge with other institutions.  We can share knowledge and help at the same time.
